<p>Build a simple analytics platform for a Fake Insurance company using the <a href="https://engineering-application.britecore.com/dataset.zip">Kaggle dataset</a> <strong><a href="https://www.kaggle.com/moneystore/agencyperformance">Agency Performance Model</a></strong>. This platform has two components: An ETL or Data Pipelines and an API.</p>
<h2>Minimum Requirements</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Build a Data Pipeline/ETL process that takes the CSVs as input and 
saves into a database at a detailed level while also calculating 
summarized views. These summarized views could follow star schema or any
 other that you think will allow for easy querying using different 
pivots/dimensions. The Data Pipeline can be manually triggered by 
running a script (include instructions of how to do it!) or automated 
somehow.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Build an API (REST or GraphQL) that provides:</p>
<ul>
<li>Detailed information using different parameters (like agency, month, year, state, etc)</li>
<li>Summarized information using different parameters (like agency, month, year, state, etc)</li>
<li>An XLS, XLSX or CSV report with Premium info by Agency and Product Line using date range as parameters</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Data Pipeline/ETL process and also the logic for generating the report must be done using Pandas</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Deployment to AWS</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>ETL/Data Pipeline Flow</h3>
<p><img src="BriteCore%20Engineering%20Application_files/data_pipeline.png" alt=""></p>
<h2>Tech Stack Requirements</h2>
<p>The following are requirements on the tech stack. This stack demonstrates mastery of tools our team favors:</p>
<ul>
<li>Server-Side Development: Python 2.7+ or 3.5+ and Pandas for the API and report</li>
<li>Server Framework: Django, Flask or SimpleHTTPServer</li>
</ul>
<p>Make sure that your instructions for accessing or otherwise running your code are extremely clear.</p>
<h3>Bonus points</h3>
<p>We know people may have jobs or other important things to do, leaving
 them little time available to complete our project. The above are the 
minimum requirements. Any of the following could make you stand out from
 the crowd by showing you current proficiency with other skills and 
tools:</p>
<ul>
<li>Integration or Unit tests (at least one of those). You can use <code>pytest</code> or <code>unittest</code></li>
<li>Authentication so that only authorized users can query the API</li>
<li>Tests with good test coverage</li>
<li>Documented code and that follows pep8 and The Zen of Python</li>
<li>API documentation</li>
<li>Using docker for deployment</li>
<li>Using other AWS stack components relevant for Data Engineering (Lambdas, S3, DynamoDb, Cognito, etc.)</li>
<li>Using any CI service like Travis, Shippable, Circle CI, etc. for running the tests</li>
<li>Including some predictive analysis like forecasting or categorization as part of the API</li>
<li>Incremental ETL that only processes and loads new records</li>
<li>Build a web app that consumes the API (we use Vue.js and Knockout)
<ul>
<li>Show some charts, tables, dashboards</li>
<li>Let users run reports with different input parameters and date ranges from there</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Guidelines</h2>
<p>We're looking for someone who can work independently and is curious 
and self-motivated. One major goal of this project is to see how you 
fill in ambiguities creatively. There is no such thing as a perfect 
project here, just interpretations of the instructions above, so be 
creative in your approach.</p>
<h2>Deliverables</h2>
<p>In order to move your application forward, deliverables will include:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A deployed version of your project, on AWS.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A GitHub repo containing your project. Your repo must contain these two items:</p>
<ul>
<li>A detailed README that explains your approach and deployment method</li>
<li>Your code solution to this test</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adding of these items to your resume's cover letter:</p>
<ul>
<li>The link to the GitHub repo that lists this project</li>
<li>The link to the deployed version of your project</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Uploading of your resume with cover letter in PDF or DOCX format by <a href="https://hire.withgoogle.com/public/jobs/britecorecom/view/P_AAAAAAEAADyHOT0mDchE4T">clicking this link</a>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
